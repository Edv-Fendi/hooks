# React Hooks Examples

Welcome to my personal repository of React Hooks examples! This repository serves as a reference and a toolkit for anyone looking to understand and implement React Hooks in their projects.

## About This Repository

In this repository, you'll find practical examples of various React Hooks, which I've put together to help myself and others better understand their usage in different scenarios. Here are the hooks covered:

- **useState**: Manage state in a functional component.
- **useEffect**: Perform side effects in functional components.
- **useContext**: Access and use React context.
- **useReducer**: An alternative to useState for complex state logic.
- **useCallback**: Memoize callbacks to optimize performance.
- **useMemo**: Memoize values to optimize performance.
- **useRef**: Persist values between renders without triggering a re-render.

Each hook example is contained within its own folder, complete with detailed comments explaining how and why to use them.
